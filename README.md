# KA Mensa

KA Mensa is an iOS/watchOS/iPadOS/MacOS app for the canteens of the unis in Karlsruhe, for example KIT. 
All canteens by the Studierendenwerk Karlsruhe are supported.

It is a modern and simple App built with SwiftUI, motivated by the awful and outdated official iOS canteen app.

## Download
The app is available on the AppStore: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ka-mensa/id1604756558?l=en

Beta testers can install beta builds using Testflight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/EpjqYaXJ.

## Contribution

Please feel free to contribute! The App does work and looks nice, but there's many possible improvements:
- fix known bugs
- cache fetched data so that the app doesn't need to reload every time
- implement widgets, to display canteens even without opening the app
- implement Siri support, to ask Siri what's on the menu
- improve the iPad version to display multiple days side by side
